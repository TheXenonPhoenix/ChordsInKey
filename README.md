# ChordsInKey
This is a script that returns the chords in a scale

This Code prompts the user for two inputs
  1. Key
  2. Mode (currently only works for Major)
  
Then it outputs the notes in the 7 chords of the scale.

Sample output:

  Enter a Key: C
  Enter a Mode: Major
  Here are the chords in C Major
  The 1 chord is: ('C', 'E', 'G')
  The 2 chord is: ('D', 'F', 'A')
  The 3 chord is: ('E', 'G', 'B')
  The 4 chord is: ('F', 'A', 'C')
  The 5 chord is: ('G', 'B', 'D')
  The 6 chord is: ('A', 'C', 'E')
  The 7 chord is: ('B', 'D', 'F')
